# Unmanaged instance groups

Unmanaged instance groups can contain heterogeneous instances that you can arbitrarily add and remove from the group.

Unmanaged instance groups do not offer autoscaling, autohealing, rolling update support, multi-zone support, or the use of instance templates and are not a good fit for deploying highly available and scalable workloads.

Use unmanaged instance groups if you need to apply load balancing to groups of heterogeneous instances, or if you need to manage the instances yourself.
